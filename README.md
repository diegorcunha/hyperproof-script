##  AI Tools

I used the AI tools to help me to generate the commands, but the script file was created by me. Still, the entire process and the validation of the code is the responsibility of the engineer that is using the AI, so it help a lot in some tasks that is necessary to create some command or specific resolution. Still, for me the essential is to know how to use the tool and how it can improve my job, but always will be necessary understand in deep how everything works before start to use some tools to help.
